Personally I have a long history of designing and building websites only to take them down a few weeks later.
I guess it's just some sick and twisted sense of perfectionism that makes it so I'm never quite pleased with my own work.
For this blog I've finally decided to just go with an pre-existing theme
so I can just write about the things I'm passionate about rather than worry about elements not being perfectly centered.

The past year I've been working on just simplifying the stuff in my life that doesn't really matter.
For example I used to have like 5 Spotify playlists. I ended up just moving everything into one and even that gave some kind of peace.
I also used to be obsessed with running my own webservers but since I also do that for a living I wanted my personal projects to be simpler.

Wherever possible I now heavily rely on the power of static site generators and the services allowing you to host their output at next to no cost/effort.
Now both this blog and my [personal site](https://dylanmaassen.nl) run on Cloudflare Pages and changing them is as simple as a git push.

As for this blog, I'm pretty technical so a good chunk of my posts will be about the latest newest tool I've found to achieve something.
However, I don't want it to just be technobabble. I *hopefully* have more on my mind ;)
