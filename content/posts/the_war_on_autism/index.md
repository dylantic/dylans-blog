Man, what a title. No worries though, I'm keeping this post relatively light-hearted :)  

There's been a shift in representation of autism over the past few years and it appears public opinion has shifted in a *mostly* positive way, but there are some things I am not entirely satisfied with.
Some people have started treating their diagnosis as a personality rather than something that affects them, personally I think that downplays the disorder in a way that could be damaging in the long run.  

Of course everyone has their own way of dealing with things, for example a diagnosis with a neurodevelopmental disorder. But treating it as... a novelty almost, just a *quirky* trait, is signalling to thousands 
of newly diagnosed people that they shouldn't have to adapt to society because they can just blame their oddities on autism and that's that. Sadly society doesn't work that way, and they're bound to hit roadblocks soon enough.

### Me, myself, I

My personal experience with autism can best be described as everyone else just getting handed pages to a thick book titled "Guide to Society" throughout their youth, while my copy must've gotten lost in the post.  

Getting diagnosed in 2015 (right after the [big autistic merger&trade;](https://web.archive.org/web/20101225152454/http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=97)) with Classic Autism (the OG baybeee) somehow caused me to actively try to improve and I started writing my own "book".
Now, my book is in no way, shape, or form complete or in any way close to the copy everyone else got, but I'm making do. However it appears that a popular sound at the moment is **"Why should I have to adapt, it's society that's wrong!"**.
In many ways, society *is* wrong. But it's also wrong to believe that you shouldn't adapt to interact with it "properly".

I hold the strong belief that autism is a disorder and not merely a 'difference'. It's something that diverts from normal development. However, that doesn't mean I think autism should be 'cured'. I don't think I'd take the cure even if it was available.
Saying it's a 'difference' immediately invalidates everyone (autistic people, their caretakers/parents etc.) who seeks therapy or other kinds of help. It's a disorder, you are experiencing symptoms. If you want you can get help with them.
