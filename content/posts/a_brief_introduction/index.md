## Salutations

I'm Dylan Maassen van den Brink, as of writing this I am 26 years old, and I live in the city of Arnhem in the Netherlands. I like to spend my time gaming, playing around with server stuff, listening to music and as of recently I've taken to going on walks. My LEGO collection is nothing short of impressive, okay that was a lie, but I do have all the plants.

For my music taste I implore you to check out my main playlist on Deezer (the widget doesn't support volume control so lower your system volume)

I currently work at {{<extlink text="de Volksbank" url="https://www.devolksbank.nl/en" >}}, mostly from home but once or twice a week at the office in 's-Hertogenbosch (Den Bosch, if you're so inclined). Before that I've worked at {{<extlink text="Elonisas" url="https://elonisas.nl" >}} and {{<extlink text="Savvii" url="https://www.savvii.com" >}}
